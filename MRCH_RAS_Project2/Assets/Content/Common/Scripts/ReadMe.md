I used Assembly definitions and abstract & Wrappers.

Here the .asmdef is used, so you cannot directly change the reference. Know more about Assembly Definition
at: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html

Meanwhile, most of the scripts are abstract and inheritable. So if you know what it is, you can directly inherit the class offered and modify them yourself.

NO MATTER WHAT, YOU ARE **NOT SUPPOSE TO CHANGE THE SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER** FOR EASIER INTERGRATION OF THE COURSE PROJECTS LATER.

Instead, if you find any bugs or want me to develop functions , contact Shengyang (mailto: billy.peng@nyu.edu) .

BTW, if you are interested in my codes, you are welcomed to find me to have further detailed instructions on my codes
XD.
